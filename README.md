**Hey, I'm Alia!**

I'm a transfem from Australia with Anxiety among other things.
I code small projects in Python to keep myself entertained and I'm currently learning C#, Unity, and HTML.

For more about me, check out the website I'm making, which can find it [here](https://abnormalnormality.github.io/AbnormalNormality/)!
